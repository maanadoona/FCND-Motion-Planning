# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes code to make grid and to find the path.

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
I opened the csv file to get the value of latitude and longitude. these are on first line as string. So I split and cut the string to get numbers. finally I change the number to floating type.
Next, I use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home.

And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!

#### 2. Set your current local position
I use the  global_to_local() method to change global postion to local postion of (North, East , Down)

Meanwhile, here's a picture of me flying through the trees!

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
I tried two algorithms to make grid. First one is medival. The other is Graph Search.
I got the good flying result from medival. but I couldn't get flight from Graph Search because connection is lost from simulator, TIMEOUT. I think Graph Search computation time is longer than timeout.

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
I got the gps location from this web site : https://www.gps-coordinates.net/
I select the goal position as below. I use the skeleton and I got the path (green)

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
When I use the skeleton, I need to move up-right/left, down-right/left. So, I set those movement in Action function in planning_util.py and set the cost as sqrt(2).


#### 6. Cull waypoints 
I use the collinearity_prune() method to reduce unnecessary waypoints. When I didn't use it. flying car moves step by step.


### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
